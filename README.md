# pycounterstrings
A Python library providing functions to generate "counterstrings" for testing e.g. text fields. It is based on [PerlClip](http://www.satisfice.com/tools.shtml) and the blog post [Counterstrings: Self-Describing Test Data](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/22) by James Bach.

> Sometimes you need to test a text field or document with different kinds of stressful inputs. But, it can be a pain to prepare the text data. PerlClip is a tool that helps you do that.
